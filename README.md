# SpaceX Launches

## Description

App that pulls in and displays SpaceX api rocket launch data with the ability to filter the results based on successful landings, reused rockets, and with Reddit. Users can sort the data based on launch date and should update the data on refresh. 

## Solution Notes

Here is how I approached the project:

- Start by setting up the React / Redux file structure
- Determine what components were required and build out component file tree
- Determine what data needed to be store in the store and what could be saved in state
- Begin building out components using Photoshop to figure out the exact font and image sizing along with margin and padding for all elements
- Test to make sure functions and components were responding as desired

## Getting Started
